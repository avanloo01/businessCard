# Day 34 in Kenya

*2025-07-22*

Although it seemed like today was taking a false start, it turned out to be a productive day. I went to Elewa and had a good meeting with the CEO, and I got started with my work at Zaribee, which is really energizing. It felt great to just be in an office and be able to work on something meaningful. The only unfortunate thing that happened today is my thesis: I put in a lot of effort to send a proposal to my supervisor, but I got a reply that clearly showed I need to work harder on it. My life is improving. So, I will definitely have more time for it. I'm just a bit afraid right now...

Tomorrow is another energizing day. I will visit Elewa again and go to Zaribee afterwards. There are a lot of work opportunities in Nairobi, and I hope I can be transparent to everyone that has offered me opportunities. I will continue to work hard, stay focused, and stay confident.

Our approach remains the same, and itâ€™s still Day 1.
