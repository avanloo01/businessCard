# Day 33 in Kenya

*2025-07-21*

Today was my 33rd day in Kenya. I feel like everything is getting back on track. My start-up story is reaching full circle, and I am gaining slowly clarity on the next steps in my career.

I am not sure yet what I will do when I graduate next year, but several paths are opening up. I am grateful for all the opportunities I have had and will have in the future. Zaribee Kenya Ltd. and Mr. Morita especially made my day. I only met Mr. Morita yesterday at a Buddhist event in Chiromo. However, he invited me to his office today, and I learned an enormous amount about microfinance and lending to boda drivers. I'm energized to figure out how I can help his business.

Tomorrow, I look forward to a meeting at Elewa and further conversations with Mr. Morita and his team. Our approach remains the same, and itâ€™s still Day 1.

Thank you God, thank you Mr. Morita, and thank you to all those who cannot be named here (yet).

Sincerely, 

Arthur
